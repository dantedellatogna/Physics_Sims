Small project made for fun. It consists in simulating a solar system following the [Newton's law of universal gravitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_universal_gravitation).

The 2D graphics were generated making use of the pygame library, while the physics behind the interactions were calculated from scratch using python's standard libraries.
